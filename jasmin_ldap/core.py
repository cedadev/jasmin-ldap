class ConnectionPool:
    """
    Represents a pool of active connections, all bound with the same username and
    password. The pool is thread-safe in the sense that two threads cannot get
    the same connection as long as they are both using the pool properly. It
    *is* possible for a single thread to acquire two different connections though,
    if it acquires a second connection before it is finished with the first (i.e.
    if there is an in-progress paged search).

    The recommended way to use the connection pool is via the context manager
    support. This ensures the connection is released back to the pool:

    ::

        pool = ConnectionPool(...)
        with pool.connection() as conn:
            # ... Do something with the connection ...

    The connection should not be released to the pool until the consumer is finished
    with it (since it may get closed or re-used). This is particularly troublesome
    for searching - because :py:class:`Connection`\ s use paged search to fetch
    results in batches, the connection must be held until all the results have
    been iterated over.

    When a connection is acquired, the pool is checked, and if there is an idle
    connection it is returned. If there is no idle connection, a new connection
    is created and returned.

    When a connection is released to the pool, we first check to see if there is
    space for it (i.e. have we already got ``max_size`` idle connections in the
    pool). If there is space, we add it to the pool. If there is no space, the
    connection is closed.

    If there is a problem with a connection while using it, don't release it back
    to the pool. However, you shoudl ensure it is closed. When using the context
    manager support (i.e. :py:meth:`ConnectionPool.connection`), all this is
    handled for you.

    This pattern hopefully facilitates some reuse of connections while always
    making sure clients can get a connection when they want one.

    The ``q`` argument can be any object supporting the same interface as
    ``queue.Queue`` - in particular, ``multiprocessing.Queue`` can be used. This
    is also how the maximum size of the pool should be changed (i.e. by creating
    a queue with the required maximum size).
